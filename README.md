My full name is Raghav Sharma and I am originally from Delhi, India. I received my undergraduate degree in Biotechnology and molecular biology from India and a master of science degree in Bioinformatics from Newark, New Jersey. I have two years work experience working as a Bioinformatics research assistant at Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia. I also have six years work exprience working in high tech companies like Acxiom Corporation (Conway, Arkansas), Deloitte (Camp Hill, Pennsylvania) and Cisco (San Jose, California). I gained experience in programming languages like core Java, Perl, Python, PL/SQL, SQL as well as Oracle databases at the above mentioned organizations. I wanted a computer science credential and hence am at SMU now.

Outside work I enjoy the outdoors - hiking, road biking, backpacking and road trips. I also like reading fiction and biographies.
